# meg_utilities
The main function is the "grand_function.m", which loops participants through each of the steps that are defined in the other batch files.

The stats can be run from the grand function or separately. All stats require text files with locations and names of the peaks.  

e.g. label_file:  
lstg  
rstg  
e.g. corresponding coords_file (MNI space):  
48 -14 -2  
-44 -64 -12
